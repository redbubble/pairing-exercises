# Redbubble Fullstack Code Pairing Exercise

Welcome to the fullstack code pairing exercise! You can choose whichever
language option (Go, Python, or Ruby) that you are comfortable with to pair with
our engineers during the session.

## Context

Each language has its own implementation of a Price Calculator app based on the
following [functional requirements](http://take-home-test.herokuapp.com/new-product-engineer).
We'll use it as a basis for our fullstack pairing exercise.

In the interview we'll talk through the structure of the codebase, your thoughts
on the design, and how you might involve it. Then we will do an extension on the
current code.

## Interview prep

- Clone this repo. For the fullstack interview, you can pick either Go, Python,
  or Ruby, and use their respective folder in the pairing session.
- Set up the app in your IDE of choice. You will be sharing your screen during
  the pairing interview.
- Make sure you can build and run the code.
- Familiarise yourself with
  - Code structure
  - Tests
  - Business logic
  - Design choices
- It's not perfect, we'd love to hear how you've improve it
