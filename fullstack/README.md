# Redbubble Fullstack Code Pairing Exercise

Welcome to the fullstack code pairing exercise!

## Context

This repository offers you the choice between four languages (Go, Javascript, Python, or Ruby).
Please select the option you are most comfortable with during the pairing session with our engineers.

Each language has its own incomplete implementation of a
[Price Calculator app](http://take-home-test.herokuapp.com/new-product-engineer),
which we'll use as the basis for our fullstack pairing exercise.

## Interview Prep

Before the interview, you'll need to set up the code on your machine. **However, please don't complete the
exercise before the interview.**

- Clone this repo. For the fullstack interview, you can pick either Go, Javascript, Python,
  or Ruby, and use their respective folder in the pairing session.
- Set up the app in your IDE of choice. You will be sharing your screen during
  the pairing interview.
- Make sure you can build and run the code.
- Familiarise yourself with
  - Code structure
  - Tests
  - Design choices
  - [Business logic](http://take-home-test.herokuapp.com/new-product-engineer)

## During The Interview

During the interview we'll talk through the structure of the codebase, and your
thoughts on the setup and design, as well as the implementation.

We won't be testing your language knowledge, but rather how you work with us to
solve interesting problems.

## Final Words

We had fun creating this exercise! It's not perfect, and we'd love to hear how you'd improve it.

And remember: **Don't complete the exercise prior to the interview!**
