# Redbubble Fullstack Code Pairing Exercise

Welcome to the fullstack code pairing exercise! You can choose whichever
language option (Go, Javascript, Python, or Ruby) you are most comfortable to pair with
our engineers during the session.

## Context

Each language has its own incomplete implementation of a Price Calculator app,
based on the following [functional requirements](http://take-home-test.herokuapp.com/new-product-engineer).
We'll use it as a basis for our fullstack pairing exercise.

Before the interview, you'll need to set up the code on your machine. **However, please don't complete the
exercise before the interview.**

During the interview we'll talk through the structure of the codebase, and your
thoughts on the setup and design, as well as the implementation. We won't be testing your language knowledge, but rather how you work with us to
solve interesting problems.

## Interview prep

- Clone this repo. For the fullstack interview, you can pick either Go, Javascript, Python,
  or Ruby, and use their respective folder in the pairing session.
- Set up the app in your IDE of choice. You will be sharing your screen during
  the pairing interview.
- Make sure you can build and run the code.
- Familiarise yourself with
  - Code structure
  - Tests
  - Business logic
  - Design choices
- We had fun creating it. It's not perfect, we'd love to hear how you'd improve it.

And remember: **Don't need to complete the exercise prior to the interview!**
